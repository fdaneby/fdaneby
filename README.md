Hello,

my name is Fredrik Daneby and I am a newly hatched Master of Science in Microbiology.

Approximately one hundred years ago, I was coding CGI-scripts and flatfile import scripts (Perl, SQL via ODBC drivers) for early (~2000) E-commerce applications. As frontend,
I created webpages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, ASP). I also studied computer science at KTH in Stockholm. Howevever, I soon felt I needed to do other things in my life and started
working in our family business (in construction) before I finished the education. After beeing stuck in that business until five years ago, I decided to do something useful with my life
and started studying microbiology. As it turned out, I had much use of my programming skills in microbiology as the field of bioinformatics is really taking off.

I have recently been creating scripts in Python, R and Perl to investigate bacterial DNA sequences. During my MSc project, I realized many bioinformatic tools and also script languages have 
caveats that need to be avoided. In some cases this has inspired me to explore the possibilites of writing my own modules/packages/addons, in other cases this has inspired me to drop interpreted 
script languages completely and move to C++ or C#. In any case, I aim to gather my scripts/programs here, though I'm currently unsure what this will lead to.
